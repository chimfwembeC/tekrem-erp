## AI Service Integration

The system integrates with multiple AI providers:

### Supported Providers
- **Mistral AI** (Default)
- **OpenAI**
- **Anthropic Claude**

### Configuration
AI services are configured through the Settings > Integrations interface:

1. Enable desired AI service
2. Configure API keys and endpoints
3. Set default models and parameters
4. Test connectivity

### Fallback Mechanisms
When AI services are unavailable, the system provides:
- Category-based fallback milestones
- Standard task templates
- Default timeline estimates
- Basic resource recommendations

## Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts for each AI function:

### Milestone Generation Prompt
- Analyzes project details and requirements
- Considers project category and complexity
- Generates 4-6 logical milestones
- Includes realistic time estimates

### Task Generation Prompt
- Breaks down natural language descriptions
- Creates specific, actionable tasks
- Assigns appropriate priorities
- Estimates effort in hours

### Timeline Estimation Prompt
- Considers project scope and complexity
- Factors in team size and experience
- Includes buffer time recommendations
- Identifies potential risk factors

### Resource Recommendation Prompt
- Analyzes project requirements
- Suggests optimal team composition
- Recommends budget allocation
- Identifies necessary tools and resources

## Data Processing

### Response Parsing
- JSON extraction from AI responses
- Data validation and sanitization
- Error handling for malformed responses
- Confidence scoring

### Fallback Data
- Category-specific templates
- Industry standard estimates
- Historical project data
- Best practice recommendations

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data sent to external AI services
- Project descriptions are anonymized when possible
- API keys encrypted in database
- Audit logging for all AI requests

### Access Control
- Admin and staff roles required
- Project-level permissions respected
- Rate limiting on AI requests
- Usage monitoring and reporting

## Performance Optimization

### Caching
- Response caching for similar requests
- Template-based fallbacks
- Optimized prompt templates
- Batch processing capabilities

### Rate Limiting
- Per-user request limits
- Service-level throttling
- Graceful degradation
- Queue management

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Usage Tracking
- AI request frequency
- Success/failure rates
- Response quality metrics
- User adoption statistics

### Performance Metrics
- Response time monitoring
- Accuracy assessments
- User satisfaction scores
- Cost tracking per provider

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. Provide detailed project descriptions
2. Include relevant context and constraints
3. Review AI suggestions before implementation
4. Combine AI insights with domain expertise

### For Administrators
