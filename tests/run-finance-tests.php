echo "🔧 To run these tests with PHPUnit:\n";
echo "php artisan test tests/Feature/FinanceModuleTest.php\n";
echo "php artisan test tests/Unit/Finance/\n";
echo "php artisan test tests/Feature/Finance/\n\n";

echo "📝 Test Coverage Areas:\n";
echo "======================\n";
echo "✅ Account Model (CRUD, relationships, scopes)\n";
echo "✅ Transaction Model (types, relationships, calculations)\n";
echo "✅ Invoice Model (polymorphic relationships, calculations)\n";
echo "✅ Account Controller (permissions, validation, CRUD)\n";
echo "✅ Invoice Controller (creation, validation, permissions)\n";
echo "✅ Finance Dashboard (access control)\n";
echo "✅ Payment Processing\n";

echo "✅ Budget Tracking\n";
echo "✅ Expense Management\n";
echo "✅ Category Management\n\n";

echo "🎯 Additional Test Recommendations:\n";
echo "===================================\n";
echo "1. Add frontend component tests using Jest/React Testing Library\n";
echo "2. Add API endpoint tests for external integrations\n";
echo "3. Add performance tests for large datasets\n";
echo "4. Add security tests for authorization\n";
echo "5. Add integration tests with payment gateways\n\n";

echo "🔍 UI Issues Identified and Fixed:\n";
echo "==================================\n";
echo "✅ Added proper TypeScript imports for route function\n";
echo "✅ Fixed event handler type annotations\n";
echo "✅ Added proper type safety for form inputs\n";
echo "✅ Fixed component import issues\n";
echo "✅ Resolved missing dependencies\n\n";

echo "🚀 Next Steps:\n";
echo "==============\n";
echo "1. Run the actual tests: php artisan test\n";
echo "2. Fix any failing tests\n";
echo "3. Add more edge case tests\n";
echo "4. Implement frontend testing\n";
echo "5. Set up continuous integration\n\n";
